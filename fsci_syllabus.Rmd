# Intro

Hello everyone. I'm looking forward to our session at [FSCI 2020](https://www.force11.org/fsci/2020) on ["W24 - Working with Scholarly Literature in R: Pulling, Wrangling, Cleaning, and Analyzing Structured Bibliographic Metadata."](https://www.force11.org/fsci/2020/fsci-2020-course-abstracts#W24)

# Course Information
**Title:** Working with Scholarly Literature in R: Pulling, Wrangling, Cleaning, and Analyzing Structured Bibliographic Metadata

**Instructor:**
Clarke Iakovakis, Scholarly Services Librarian, Oklahoma State University, <https://info.library.okstate.edu/clarke-iakovakis>

**Website:** <https://ciakovx.github.io/fsci_syllabus.html>

**Acknowledgments:** Acknowledgements for this course go to the organizations and developers who have created the APIs we have used and made them open--namely Crossref, Orcid, and Unpaywall; those who have created the software, packages and tools we are using--namely the R Core Team, the RStudio Team, Hadley Wickham, Karthik Ram, Najko Jahn, Scott Chamberlain, rOpenSci, Yihui Xie, Garrett Grolemund, Linus Torvalds, Scott Chacon, Ben Straub, Git, GitHub, The Binder Project, and Project Jupyter; and finally those who have created enormously helpful resources for learning and teaching R--namely Roger Peng, Jeff Leek, Coursera, the Carpentries, Lisa Federer, Brad Boehmke, Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo. I have benefitted from many, many more have dedicated their time, labor, and effort that I have overlooked. It is only due to the generosity and dedication of these people and organizations I am able to put this class together.

# Description: 
Developers have created a number of packages for accessing the scholarly literature in R over the last several years, among them `rcrossref`, `rorcid`, and `roadoi.` These packages make use of the APIs in their systems to allow users to execute specific queries and pull the structured data into R, where it can be reshaped, merged with other data, and analyzed. This session will be based on the workshop I provided at last year's FSCI. The course will assume no experience with R; however, a thorough explanation of the R programming language will not be provided. 

The course will a mixture of pre-recorded videos and synchronous meeting for discussion and Q&A sessions. 

Students will access IPNYB (Jupyter Notebooks) files containing the scripts for the workshop, created with [binder](https://mybinder.org/). The files will include executable code alongside descriptions of what the code is doing. Students can therefore run code that has already been written, but will also write and execute their own R scripts within the Jupyter Notebooks environment. Students will access these notebooks while watching the videos explaining the code.

We will begin with a general orientation of the Jupyter Notebooks environment. We will then discuss R and provide a basic overview of how it works. This introduction will include reading data into R, installing packages, and some functions for cleaning and restructuring data. We will then discuss Crossref, ORCID, and Unpaywall, and the packages developed by the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) organization to access the API services of these organizations, and walk through `rcrossref`, `roadoi`, and `rorcid`.

* `rcrossref` interfaces with the CrossRef API, allowing users to pull article metadata based on ISSN, filter queries by publication date and license information, running queries by title and author, getting funder data, getting citation counts, and exporting to BibTeX, RIS, and CSV. This can be immensely powerful for collecting citation data, conducting literature reviews, creating bibliographies, and more.
* `roadoi` interfaces with Unpaywall, allowing users to input a set of DOIs and return publication information along with potential locations of open access versions.
* `rorcid` interfaces with the ORCID API, allowing users to pull publication data based on a specific ORCID iD, or to input names and other identifying information to find a specific individual’s identifier. 

As we work through the tutorials, students will continue to learn R functions for working with data, including `dplyr`, `purrr`, and `tidyr`. 

By the conclusion of the session, students will be able to work with and analyze data in R. On a deeper level, they will have more powerful tools for gathering subsets of the scholarly literature in clean and structured formats based on specific parameters. Because they will be walking away with executable scripts, they will be able to modify those and collect data based on parameters they are interested in. 

# Level: 
All levels

# Intended audience: 
This course is intended for scholarly communications librarians, repository managers, research funders, publishers, bibliometricians, and managers of Research Information Management Systems (RIMS).

# Requirements: 
Students will need a computer with internet access. It will not be necessary to download R or R Studio, as all code will be executed in Jupyter Notebooks in the browser, hosted by binder.

# Course Learning Objectives
A participant in this course will, at the end of the course, be able to:

* Use R to complete a range of data tasks, including understanding R syntax and data types, installing and loading packages, reading data from files and APIs, and executing functions for tidying and  analyzing data.
* Use the `rorcid` package in R to extract data from ORCID profiles, including authenticating with the ORCID API, finding ORCID iDs by name/affiliation, getting author biographical information, and getting works associated with individuals.
* Use the `rcrossref` and `roadoi` packages in R to extract data from the Crossref and Unpaywall database, including authenticating with the Crossref API, forming queries, getting publication information, getting data on articles, converting articles to BibTeX/RIS, getting citation data, and checking for open access versions.

# Course Topics
This course will cover these  topics:

* Introduction to Binder and Jupyter Notebooks
* Introduction to `rcrossref` and `roadoi`
* Introduction to `rorcid`


# Course Schedule

## DAY ONE: Wednesday, August 5

### Live Zoom Sessions 
* 8-9AM: Introductory session
* 5-6PM: REPEAT Introductory session

**ALL TIMES PACIFIC**
[Convert time](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/)

### Exercises

Try to complete this by beginning of class, but it's fine if you push it until after we meet. I'll be discussing some of this during that session.

**1. Using Jupyter Notebooks: 30 minutes**

* This lesson is required.
* Launch the Using Jupyter Notebooks Jupyter Notebook at [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ciakovx/ciakovx.github.io/master?filepath=using_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
* Watch the Using Jupyter Notebooks video tutorial at <COMING SOON>

**2. Introduction to R: 30 minutes**

* This lesson is optional.
* No Jupyter Notebook for this lesson
* Skim the [Introduction to R](IntroductionToR.html) webpage for information on what R is, how it applies to librarianship, what R Studio is, and some useful help resources. We will not be using R Studio in this class; instead, we will be working entirely with Jupyter Notebooks, but if you are going further in your R journey you will want to use R Studio.
