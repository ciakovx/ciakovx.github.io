    "# Load packages\n",
    "When you download R it already has a number of functions built in: these encompass what is called **Base R**. However, many R users write their own libraries of functions, package them together in R **packages**, and provide them to the R community at no charge. This extends the capacity of R and allows us to do much more. In many cases, they improve on the Base R functions by making them easier and more straight-forward to use. In addition to `rorcid`, we will also be using the `dplyr`, `purrr`, `tidyr`, `anytime`, `lubridate`, and `janitor` packages. Some of these packages are part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of R packages designed for data science.\n",

    "If you are using R and R Studio, you will need to use `install.packages()` function to install the packages first. We have already installed the packages here in our Binder repository, so we will simply load them by calling `library()`. Let's also set an option to see a max number of 100 columns and max 20 rows in our Jupyter Notebooks environment, to make printed tables easier to look at."
