    "# Load packages\n",
    "When you download R it already has a number of functions built in: these encompass what is called **Base R**. However, many R users write their own libraries of functions, package them together in R **packages**, and provide them to the R community at no charge. This extends the capacity of R and allows us to do much more. In many cases, they improve on the Base R functions by making them easier and more straight-forward to use. In addition to `rorcid`, we will also be using the `dplyr`, `purrr`, `tidyr`, `anytime`, `lubridate`, and `janitor` packages. Some of these packages are part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of R packages designed for data science.\n",

    "If you are using R and R Studio, you will need to use `install.packages()` function to install the packages first. We have already installed the packages here in our Binder repository, so we will simply load them by calling `library()`. Let's also set an option to see a max number of 100 columns and max 20 rows in our Jupyter Notebooks environment, to make printed tables easier to look at."

    "The ORCID API is an excellent tool for analyzing research activity on multiple levels. `rorcid` makes gathering and cleaning the data easier. Thanks to both ORCID and Scott Chamberlain for their contributions to the community. Again, read Paul Oldham's excellent post at https://www.pauloldham.net/introduction-to-orcid-with-rorcid/ for more you can do. I hope this walkthrough  helps.
