    "\n",
    "* **Do not use names of functions that already exist in R:** The assignment operator assigns a value to a symbol. We can pretty much pick any symbol, or name, for that variable, as long as it is not already a function in R. For example, you wouldn't want to name a variable `sum` because if you might end up in a confusing situation writing `sum(sum)`\n",
    "* **R is case sensitive**: It is important to note that R is *case sensitive.* If you try evaluating a capital `Y`, you will be told `Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found`.\n",
    "* **No blank spaces or symbols other than underscores**: R users get around this in a couple of ways, either through capitalization (e.g. `myData`) or underscores (e.g. `my_data`). \n",
    "* **Do not begin with numbers or symbols**: Try to evaluate `1z &lt;- 4` or `%z &lt;- 4` and read the error message.\n",
    "* **Be descriptive, but make your variable names short**: It's good practice to be descriptive with your variable names. If you're loading in a lot of data, choosing `myData` or `x` as a name may not be as helpful as, say, `ebookUsage`. Finally, keep your variable names short, since you will likely be typing them in frequently.\n",
