However, many R users write their own libraries of functions, package them together in R **packages**, and provide them to the R community at no charge. This extends the capacity of R and allows us to do much more. In many cases, they improve on the Base R functions by making them easier and more straight-forward to use. In addition to `rcrossref`, we will also be using the `dplyr`, `purrr`, `stringr` and `tidyr` packages. These packages are part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of R packages designed for data science.\n\nIf you are using R and R Studio, you will need to use `install.packages()` function to install the packages first. We have already installed the packages here in our Binder repository, so we will simply load them by calling `library()`. Let's also set an option to see a max number of 100 columns and max 20 rows in our Jupyter Notebooks environment, to make printed tables easier to look at."

By using `cr_journals` with `works = FALSE`, you can determine who publishes the journal, the total number of articles for the journal in Crossref, whether abstracts are included, if the full text of articles is deposited, if author ORCIDs are provided, and if the publisher supplies author affiliations, author ORCID iDs, article licensing data, funders for the article, article references, and a few other items. \n\nFirst we will create a new vector `plosone_issn` with the ISSN for the journal *PLoS ONE*.

In Crossref parlance, a \"work\" is just a thing identified by a DOI. In practice, Crossref DOIs are used as citation identifiers. So, in FRBR terms, this means, that a Crossref DOI tends to refer to one *expression* which might include multiple *manifestations*. So, for example, the ePub, HTML and PDF version of an article will share a Crossref DOI because the differences between them should not effect the interpretation or crediting of the content. In short, they can be cited interchangeably. The same is true of the \"accepted manuscript\" and the \"version-of-record\" of that accepted manuscript.\n\n\n## Searching by DOI\n\nYou can pass a DOI directly to `cr_works()` using the `dois` argument:"

Furthermore, we can only search a very limited number of fields and this will inevitably result in lower returns than commercial databases such as Web of Science (where abstracts and author keywords are available). \nUnfortunately there is no boolean AND for Crossref queries (see https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/issues/135 and  https://twitter.com/CrossrefSupport/status/1073601263659610113). However, as discussed above, the Crossref API assigns a score to each item returned giving a measure of the API's confidence in the match, and if you connect words using `+` the Crossref API will give items with those terms a higher score.\n\n## Specifying field queries to `cr_works()` with `flq`\n\nAs with `cr_journals`, you can use `flq` to pass field queries on to `cr_works()`, such as author.\n\nHere we search for the book *Open Access* by Peter Suber by doing a general keyword search for \"open access\" and an author search for \"suber\":\n"
