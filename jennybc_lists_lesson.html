<div id="inspect-and-explore" class="section level2">
<h2>Inspect and explore</h2>
<p>List inspection is very important and also fairly miserable. Before you can apply a function to every element of a list, you’d better understand the list!</p>
<p>You need to develop a toolkit for list inspection. Be on the look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the length of the list?</li>
<li>Are the components homogeneous, i.e. do they have the same overall structure, albeit containing different data?</li>
<li>Note the length, names, and types of the constituent objects.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what’s in this list or what its structure is! Please send help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand this is <strong>situation normal</strong>, especially when your list comes from querying a poorly documented API. This is often true even when your list has been created completely within R. How many of us perfectly understand the structure of a fitted linear model object? You just have to embark on a voyage of discovery and figure out what’s in there. Happy trails.</p>
<div id="indexing-review" class="section level3">
<h3>Indexing, review</h3>
<p>Remember, there are 3 ways to pull elements out of a list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>$</code> operator. Extracts a single element by name. Name can be unquoted, if syntactic.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- list(a = &quot;a&quot;, b = 2)
x$a
#&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot;
x$b
#&gt; [1] 2</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>[[</code> a.k.a. double square bracket. Extracts a single element by name or position. Name must be quoted, if provided directly. Name or position can also be stored in a variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- list(a = &quot;a&quot;, b = 2)
x[[&quot;a&quot;]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot;
x[[2]]
#&gt; [1] 2
nm &lt;- &quot;a&quot;
x[[nm]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot;
i &lt;- 2
x[[i]]
#&gt; [1] 2</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>[</code> a.k.a. single square bracket. Regular vector indexing. For a list input, this always returns a list!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- list(a = &quot;a&quot;, b = 2)
x[&quot;a&quot;]
#&gt; $a
#&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot;
x[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)]
#&gt; $a
#&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $b
#&gt; [1] 2
x[c(FALSE, TRUE)]
#&gt; $b
#&gt; [1] 2</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="str" class="section level3">
<h3><code>str()</code></h3>
<p><code>str()</code> can help with basic list inspection, although it’s still rather frustrating. Learn to love the <code>max.level</code> and <code>list.len</code> arguments. You can use them to keep the output of <code>str()</code> down to a manageable volume.</p>
<p>Once you begin to suspect or trust that your list is homogeneous, i.e. consists of sub-lists with similar structure, it’s often a good idea to do an in-depth study of a single element. In general, remember you can combine list inspection via <code>str(..., list.len = x, max.level = y)</code> with single <code>[</code> and double <code>[[</code> square bracket indexing.</p>
<p>The repurrrsive package provides examples of lists. We explore them below, to lay the groundwork for other lessons, and to demonstrate list inspection strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="listviewer-and-rstudios-object-explorer" class="section level3">
<h3>listviewer and RStudio’s Object Explorer</h3>
<p>The RStudio IDE (v1.1 and higher) offers an <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/08/22/rstudio-v1-1-preview-object-explorer/">Object Explorer</a> that provides interactive inspection and code generation tools for hierarchical objects, such as lists. You can invoke it via the GUI or in code as <code>View(YOUR_UGLY_LIST)</code>.</p>
<p>However, that won’t help you expose list exploration in something like this website. I am using the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=listviewer">listviewer</a> package to do this below. It allows you to expose list exploration in a rendered <code>.Rmd</code> document. To replicate this experience locally, call, e.g., <code>listviewer::jsonedit(got_chars, mode = "view")</code>.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the documentation on <code>str()</code>. What does <code>max.level</code> control? Apply <code>str()</code> to <code>wesanderson</code> and/or <code>got_chars</code> and experiment with <code>max.level = 0</code>, <code>max.level = 1</code>, and <code>max.level = 2</code>. Which will you use in practice with deeply nested lists?</li>
<li>What does the <code>list.len</code> argument of <code>str()</code> control? What is its default value? Call <code>str()</code> on <code>got_chars</code> and then on a single component of <code>got_chars</code> with <code>list.len</code> set to a value much smaller than the default. What range of values do you think you’ll use in real life?</li>
<li>Call <code>str()</code> on <code>got_chars</code>, specifying both <code>max.level</code> and <code>list.len</code>.</li>
<li>Call <code>str()</code> on the first element of <code>got_chars</code>, i.e. the first Game of Thrones character. Use what you’ve learned to pick an appropriate combination of <code>max.level</code> and <code>list.len</code>.</li>

<div id="vectorized-and-list-ized-operations" class="section level2">
<h2>Vectorized and “list-ized” operations</h2>
<p>Recall that many operations “just work” in a vectorized fashion in R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(3:5) ^ 2
#&gt; [1]  9 16 25
sqrt(c(9, 16, 25))
#&gt; [1] 3 4 5</code></pre>
<p>Through the magic of R, the operations “raise to the power of 2” and “take the square root” were applied to each individual element of the numeric vector input. Someone – but not you! – has written a <code>for()</code> loop:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:n) {
  output[[i]] &lt;- f(input[[i]])
}</code></pre>
<p>Automatic vectorization is possible because our input is an atomic vector: the individual atoms are always of length one, always of uniform type.</p>
<p>What if the input is a list? You have to be more intentional to apply a function <code>f()</code> to each element of a list, i.e. to “list-ize” computation. This makes sense because the data structure itself does not guarantee that it makes any sense at all to apply a common function <code>f()</code> to each element of the list. You must guarantee that.</p>
<p><code>purrr::map()</code> is a function for applying a function to each element of a list. The <a href="bk01_base-functions.html">closest base R function</a> is <code>lapply()</code>. Here’s how the square root example of the above would look if the input was in a list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(c(9, 16, 25), sqrt)
#&gt; [[1]]
#&gt; [1] 3
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[2]]
#&gt; [1] 4
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[3]]
#&gt; [1] 5</code></pre>
<p>A template for basic <code>map()</code> usage:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(YOUR_LIST, YOUR_FUNCTION)</code></pre>
<p>Below we explore these useful features of <code>purrr::map()</code> and friends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortcuts for <code>YOUR_FUNCTION</code> when you want to extract list elements by name or position</li>
<li>Simplify and specify the type of output via <code>map_chr()</code>, <code>map_lgl()</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where you begin to see the differences between <code>purrr::map()</code> and <code>base::lapply()</code>.</p>
<div id="name-and-position-shortcuts" class="section level3">
<h3>Name and position shortcuts</h3>
<p>Who are these Game of Thrones characters?</p>
<p>We want the elements with name “name”, so we do this (we restrict to the first few elements purely to conserve space):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(got_chars[1:4], &quot;name&quot;)
#&gt; [[1]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Theon Greyjoy&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[2]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Tyrion Lannister&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[3]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Victarion Greyjoy&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[4]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Will&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We are exploiting one of purrr’s most useful features: a shortcut to create a function that extracts an element based on its name.</p>
<p>A companion shortcut is used if you provide a positive integer to <code>map()</code>. This creates a function that extracts an element based on position.</p>
<p>The 3rd element of each character’s list is his or her name and we get them like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(got_chars[5:8], 3)
#&gt; [[1]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Areo Hotah&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[2]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Chett&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[3]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Cressen&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; [[4]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;Arianne Martell&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To recap, here are two shortcuts for making the <code>.f</code> function that <code>map()</code> will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide “TEXT” to extract the element named “TEXT”
<ul>
<li>equivalent to <code>function(x) x[["TEXT"]]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>provide <code>i</code> to extract the <code>i</code>-th element
<ul>
<li>equivalent to <code>function(x) x[[i]]</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You will frequently see <code>map()</code> used together with <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html">the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code></a>. These calls produce the same result as the above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>got_chars %&gt;% 
  map(&quot;name&quot;)
got_chars %&gt;% 
  map(3)</code></pre>

<li>Use <code>names()</code> to inspect the names of the list elements associated with a single character. What is the index or position of the <code>playedBy</code> element? Use the character and position shortcuts to extract the <code>playedBy</code> elements for all characters.</li>
<li>What happens if you use the character shortcut with a string that does not appear in the lists’ names?</li>
<li>What happens if you use the position shortcut with a number greater than the length of the lists?</li>
<li>What if these shortcuts did not exist? Write a function that takes a list and a string as input and returns the list element that bears the name in the string. Apply this to <code>got_chars</code> via <code>map()</code>. Do you get the same result as with the shortcut? Reflect on code length and readability.</li>
<li>Write another function that takes a list and an integer as input and returns the list element at that position. Apply this to <code>got_chars</code> via <code>map()</code>. How does this result and process compare with the shortcut?</li>

<h3>Type-specific map</h3>
<p><code>map()</code> always returns a list, even if all the elements have the same flavor and are of length one. But in that case, you might prefer a simpler object: <strong>an atomic vector</strong>.</p>
<p>If you expect <code>map()</code> to return output that can be turned into an atomic vector, it is best to use a type-specific variant of <code>map()</code>. This is more efficient than using <code>map()</code> to get a list and then simplifying the result in a second step. Also purrr will alert you to any problems, i.e. if one or more inputs has the wrong type or length. This is the <a href="bk00_vectors-and-lists.html#coercion">increased rigor about type alluded to in the section about coercion</a>.</p>
<p>Our current examples are suitable for demonstrating <code>map_chr()</code>, since the requested elements are always character.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_chr(got_chars[9:12], &quot;name&quot;)
#&gt; [1] &quot;Daenerys Targaryen&quot; &quot;Davos Seaworth&quot;     &quot;Arya Stark&quot;        
#&gt; [4] &quot;Arys Oakheart&quot;
map_chr(got_chars[13:16], 3)
#&gt; [1] &quot;Asha Greyjoy&quot;    &quot;Barristan Selmy&quot; &quot;Varamyr&quot;         &quot;Brandon Stark&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Besides <code>map_chr()</code>, there are other variants of <code>map()</code>, with the target type conveyed by the name:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>map_lgl()</code>, <code>map_int()</code>, <code>map_dbl()</code></li>
</ul>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For each character, the second element is named “id”. This is the character’s id in the <a href="https://anapioficeandfire.com">API Of Ice And Fire</a>. Use a type-specific form of <code>map()</code> and an extraction shortcut to extract these ids into an integer vector.</li>
<li>Use your list inspection strategies to find the list element that is logical. There is one! Use a type-specific form of <code>map()</code> and an extraction shortcut to extract these values for all characters into a logical vector.</li>

<div id="extract-multiple-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Extract multiple values</h3>
<p>What if you want to retrieve multiple elements? Such as the character’s name and culture? First, recall how we do this with the list for a single user:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>got_chars[[3]][c(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;born&quot;)]
#&gt; $name
#&gt; [1] &quot;Victarion Greyjoy&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $culture
#&gt; [1] &quot;Ironborn&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $gender
#&gt; [1] &quot;Male&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $born
#&gt; [1] &quot;In 268 AC or before, at Pyke&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We use single square bracket indexing and a character vector to index by name. How will we ram this into the <code>map()</code> framework? To paraphrase Chambers, <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#all-calls">“everything that happens in R is a function call”</a> and indexing with <code>[</code> is no exception.</p>
<p>It feels (and maybe looks) weird, but we can map <code>[</code> just like any other function. Recall <code>map()</code> usage:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(.x, .f, ...)</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>.f</code> will be <code>[</code>. And we finally get to use <code>...</code>! This is where we pass the character vector of the names of our desired elements. We inspect the result for two characters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- map(got_chars, `[`, c(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;born&quot;))
str(x[16:17])
#&gt; List of 2
#&gt;  $ :List of 4
#&gt;   ..$ name   : chr &quot;Brandon Stark&quot;
#&gt;   ..$ culture: chr &quot;Northmen&quot;
#&gt;   ..$ gender : chr &quot;Male&quot;
#&gt;   ..$ born   : chr &quot;In 290 AC, at Winterfell&quot;
#&gt;  $ :List of 4
#&gt;   ..$ name   : chr &quot;Brienne of Tarth&quot;

#&gt;   ..$ gender : chr &quot;Female&quot;
#&gt;   ..$ born   : chr &quot;In 280 AC&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Some people find this ugly and might prefer the <code>extract()</code> function from magrittr.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)

<div id="data-frame-output" class="section level3">
<h3>Data frame output</h3>
<p>We just learned how to extract multiple elements per user by mapping <code>[</code>. But, since <code>[</code> is non-simplifying, each user’s elements are returned in a list. And, as it must, <code>map()</code> itself returns list. We’ve traded one recursive list for another recursive list, albeit a slightly less complicated one.</p>
<p>How can we “stack up” these results row-wise, i.e. one row per user and variables for “name”, “gender”, etc.? A data frame would be the perfect data structure for this information.</p>
<p>This is what <code>map_dfr()</code> is for.</p>
